Hello there! I'm passionate about the crossroads of business and technology and am currently a product manager designing a web app from scratch for Rafiki Africa through Develop for Good. I thrive on building innovative solutions and have had the chance to do so in diverse sectors, from AI-driven apps at Tarjimly to fintech platforms like Standard Metrics.

I believe in using technology and business to make a difference, and I'd say it's a recurring theme that has guided my academic and career interests.

When I unplug, you might find me writing/singing music, practicing pilates, reading about fashion trends, building a new Lego set, or watching Studio Ghibli films. As a native Tamil speaker, I love sharing my cultural roots (the best food on earth) and learning about others.

Being a people person at heart, I thoroughly enjoy sparking up conversations, understanding different perspectives, and building meaningful relationships. Whether it's discussing the latest fintech or fashion trends, exchanging Lego sets, or sharing your favorite films, I believe in the power of conversation and connection. Let's talk!
